=== S.5 Prioritization

[role="pegs"]
NOTE: Ranking of requirements by importance and stability (MoSCoW method).

To ensure the delivery of a functional security module within the project timeline (see P.3), the system functions are prioritized as follows:

[[s5-must]]
^`S.5.{counter:s5}`^ **Must Have (Critical)** +
These features are non-negotiable. The system is useless without them.
**Intrusion Detection:** Reliable reading of sensor states (Motion/Contact).
**Local Alarm:** Triggering the siren upon confirmed intrusion.
**Arming/Disarming Logic:** The state machine (Armed/Disarmed) must work flawlessly with PIN validation.

[[s5-should]]
^`S.5.{counter:s5}`^ **Should Have (Important)** +
These features are highly desirable and should be included if no major blockers occur. +
**Remote Notification:** Sending alerts to the user's phone via simulated network call. +
**Entry/Exit Delays:** Managing the timers to allow user exit/entry without false alarms. +
**Event Logging:** Storing the history of alarms and arming actions.

[[s5-could]]
^`S.5.{counter:s5}`^ **Could Have (Optional)** +
These features are "nice to have" and will only be implemented if time permits (Phase 4). +
**Panic Button:** Manual trigger of the alarm. +
**Partial Arming:** Ability to arm only the perimeter (windows) while staying inside. +
**Battery Backup Status:** Monitoring the power supply state.

[[s5-wont]]
^`S.5.{counter:s5}`^ **Won't Have (Out of Scope)** +
These features are explicitly excluded for this version of the project to manage complexity. +
**Video Surveillance:** No video stream processing or recording. +
**Biometric Authentication:** No fingerprint or face ID; only PIN codes are used. +
**Police Interconnection:** No automated dialing of real emergency services.
