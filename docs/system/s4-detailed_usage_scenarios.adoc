=== S.4 Detailed usage scenarios

[role="pegs"]
NOTE: Step-by-step description of how the system is used in specific situations (Nominal and Alternative paths).

The following scenarios describe the dynamic behavior of the Security System from the user's and the system's perspective. They cover standard operations and critical security events.

[[s4-arming]]
^`S.4.{counter:s4}`^ **Nominal Scenario: Arming the System (Departure)** +
1. The user ensures all doors and windows are closed (sensors are in "Closed" state). +
2. The user enters the valid PIN code on the Control Panel and presses "Arm". +
3. The system validates the PIN and initiates the **Exit Delay** (e.g., 30 seconds).
4. The user leaves the house and closes the main door. +
5. Once the delay expires, the system transitions to the **Armed** state. All sensors become active.

[[s4-intrusion]]
^`S.4.{counter:s4}`^ **Critical Scenario: Intrusion Detection** +
1. The system is in the **Armed** state. +
2. An intruder forces a window open (Magnetic Contact break) or moves in the living room (Motion Sensor trigger). +
3. The system detects the sensor signal change. +
4. The system checks the zone type:
   * If **Instant Zone** (Window): The alarm triggers immediately.
   * If **Delayed Zone** (Main Door): The Entry Delay timer starts. +
5. Assuming an immediate intrusion: The **Indoor Siren** is activated, and a "Breach Alert" notification is sent to the remote user.

[[s4-disarming]]
^`S.4.{counter:s4}`^ **Nominal Scenario: Disarming (Return)** +
1. The user unlocks and opens the main entry door. +
2. The system detects the door opening and starts the **Entry Delay** (e.g., 30 seconds). It emits a low-volume warning beep. +
3. The user enters the valid PIN code on the panel before the timer expires. +
4. The system validates the code, stops the timer, and transitions to the **Disarmed** state. +
5. The siren does *not* trigger.

[[s4-panic]]
^`S.4.{counter:s4}`^ **Alternative Scenario: Panic Button** +
1. The user feels threatened while inside the house (regardless of whether the system is Armed or Disarmed). +
2. The user presses the physical or digital "Panic" button on the interface. +
3. The system **immediately** triggers the siren at full volume and sends a high-priority alert to emergency contacts.
