[[E6]]
=== E.6 Invariants

The bed always remains an external element to the SHS and cannot be considered an internal system component. Additionally, the SHS must always comply with local standards and building constraints.

Furniture, including the bed, always remains a physical element of the environment and not an internal component of the MI. Furthermore, the furniture must always be capable of adapting to the user’s profile and allowing effortless use, regardless of the user’s disability.
