[[E6]]
=== E.6 Invariants

NOTE: Properties of the environment that the system’s operation must preserve
under all conditions (see {Handbook}).

The following invariants describe environmental properties that must remain true
regardless of the operational state of the Smart Home System (SHS), including
degraded modes or power failures. These invariants constrain the system behavior
but are not enforced exclusively by it.


//---- Invariant
[[e6-bed-externality]]
^`E.6.{counter:e6}`^  
**System Boundary Preservation** :: The `Adaptable bed` and all other furniture
elements always remain part of the physical environment and must never be
considered internal components of the SHS.
//----


//---- Invariant
[[e6-mechanical-stability]]
^`E.6.{counter:e6}`^  
**Mechanical Stability** :: The physical configuration of the `Adaptable bed` must
never reach a position that compromises its structural stability or creates a risk
of tipping over.
//----


//---- Invariant
[[e6-emergency-egress]]
^`E.6.{counter:e6}`^  
**Emergency Egress** :: At least one primary exit of the `MI` must always remain
manually operable from inside the dwelling, including in the event of a total SHS
or power failure.
//----


//---- Invariant
[[e6-privacy-preservation]]
^`E.6.{counter:e6}`^  
**Privacy Preservation** :: Personal data related to the `User profile` (E.1) must
never be exposed to external networks without appropriate protection mechanisms
defined by applicable regulations.
//----


//---- Invariant
[[e6-non-harmful-motion]]
^`E.6.{counter:e6}`^  
**Non-Harmful Motion** :: Any motion of `Adaptable furniture` must never result in
physical harm to occupants; environmental conditions must ensure that motion stops
when an obstacle or resistance is encountered.
