=== E.4 Assumptions

NOTE: Properties of the environment that may be assumed, with the goal of facilitating
the project and simplifying the system (see {Handbook}).

The following assumptions describe environmental conditions and behaviors that are
considered valid for the design and operation of the Smart Home System (SHS). These
assumptions are not enforced by the system but are necessary to limit its complexity
and define its expected operational context.


//---- Assumption
[[e4-user-profile-accuracy]]
^`E.4.{counter:e4}`^  
**User Profile Accuracy** :: It is assumed that the information provided in the
`User profile` (E.1) is accurate and correctly reflects the physical, sensory, and
cognitive needs of the occupant.
//----


//---- Assumption
[[e4-sensor-integrity]]
^`E.4.{counter:e4}`^  
**Sensor Integrity** :: It is assumed that external sensors used for detecting
intrusion, smoke, or bed occupancy are correctly installed, calibrated, and not
physically tampered with.
//----


//---- Assumption
[[e4-furniture-maintenance]]
^`E.4.{counter:e4}`^  
**Furniture Maintenance** :: It is assumed that `Adaptable furniture` and the
`Adaptable bed` (E.1) are properly maintained and that their mechanical safety
features (e.g., emergency stop mechanisms) are functional.
//----


//---- Assumption
[[e4-network-availability]]
^`E.4.{counter:e4}`^  
**External Connectivity** :: Although the system is designed to be resilient, it is
assumed that Internet connectivity is available to allow remote notifications to
`Emergency Services` (E.2) when required.
//----


//---- Assumption
[[e4-occupant-cooperation]]
^`E.4.{counter:e4}`^  
**Non-malicious Occupants** :: It is assumed that legitimate occupants do not
intentionally attempt to bypass or misuse the security mechanisms of the MI.
