=== E.3 Constraints

NOTE: Obligations and limits imposed on the project and system by the environment
(see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome
Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

The operation of the Smart Home System (SHS) is constrained by regulatory,
infrastructural, and physical characteristics of the environment in which it is
deployed. These constraints impact the installation, configuration, and use of
environmental components but are not implemented by the SHS itself.


//---- Constraint
[[e3-regulatory-compliance]]
^`E.3.{counter:e3}`^  
**Regulatory Compliance** :: The Smart Home System must operate within the boundaries
defined by `Local standards` (E.1), including fire safety regulations and data
protection laws such as the GDPR.
//----


//---- Constraint
[[e3-infrastructure-availability]]
^`E.3.{counter:e3}`^  
**Physical Infrastructure Availability** :: The availability of electrical power and
internet connectivity is a prerequisite for nominal system behavior. These resources
are provided by the environment and are not controlled by the SHS.
//----


//---- Constraint
[[e3-furniture-compliance]]
^`E.3.{counter:e3}`^  
**Furniture Compliance** :: Furniture elements in the MI, including `Adaptable
furniture` and the `Adaptable bed` (E.1), must comply with accessibility, ergonomics,
and building standards applicable to the dwelling.
//----


//---- Constraint
[[e3-mechanical-boundaries]]
^`E.3.{counter:e3}`^  
**Mechanical Boundaries** :: Any movement or adjustment of adaptable furniture is
constrained by its physical range of motion and by obstacles present in the MI
environment.
