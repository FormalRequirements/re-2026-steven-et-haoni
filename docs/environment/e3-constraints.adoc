=== E.3 Constraints

NOTE: Obligations and limits imposed on the project and system by the environment (see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the Minimum Requirements Outcome Principle, p.27 of the {handbook}).

[[e-sec-01]]
* **E.SEC.01** – The dwelling is subject to applicable regulations (fire safety, GDPR).
[[e-sec-02]]
* **E.SEC.02** – Physical equipment (like the `Adaptable bed`) must be powered and operational for the SHS to fulfill its functions.

---

The system operation is constrained by local standards and the characteristics of the building in which it is deployed. These constraints may impact the installation, configuration, and usage of environmental components.

The MI furniture must comply with accessibility, ergonomics, and building standards. The adaptation mechanisms of the bed and furniture must allow use without excessive physical effort, regardless of the user’s disability.

//---- Constraint
[[e3-regulations]]
^`E.3.{counter:e3}`^  
**Regulatory Compliance** :: The SHS must operate within the boundaries of `Local standards` (E.1), including GDPR for data privacy and local fire safety codes.
//----

//---- Constraint
[[e3-power-network]]
^`E.3.{counter:e3}`^  
**Physical Infrastructure** :: The availability of electrical and internet networks is a prerequisite for nominal system behavior, although the system must remain resilient to their failure.
//----

//---- Constraint
[[e3-mechanical-limits]]
^`E.3.{counter:e3}`^  
**Mechanical Boundaries** :: Any movement of `Adaptable furniture` is constrained by its physical range of motion and the presence of obstacles in the `MI` (E.1).
