[[E5]]
=== E.5 Effects

The physical characteristics of the bed and the regulatory constraints of the building may influence the behavior of the SHS, particularly by limiting certain functionalities or requiring specific system adaptations.

The presence of adaptable furniture influences the MI behavior by enabling personalized interactions, facilitating daily actions (making the bed, tilting the bed, waking up), and improving user autonomy.

//---- Effect
[[e5-furniture-state]]
^`E.5.{counter:e5}`^  
**Furniture Reconfiguration** :: The SHS can modify the physical geometry of `Adaptable furniture` (e.g., changing the height or inclination of the `Adaptable bed`) to match the user's needs.
//----

//---- Effect
[[e5-access-control]]
^`E.5.{counter:e5}`^  
**Perimeter Modification** :: The SHS can change the state of physical barriers (locking/unlocking doors and windows) to prevent `Intrusions` or facilitate `Emergency Services` entry.
//----

//---- Effect
[[e5-ambient-conditions]]
^`E.5.{counter:e5}`^  
**Environmental Adaptation** :: The SHS can alter the lighting levels, temperature, or visual signaling within the `MI` to assist the occupant or signal a danger.
//----

//---- Effect
[[e5-alert-propagation]]
^`E.5.{counter:e5}`^  
**External Notification** :: The SHS produces a communication effect by transmitting alarms and data to `Emergency Services` (E.2) or remote caregivers.
//----

//---- Effect
[[e5-data-persistence]]
^`E.5.{counter:e5}`^  
**Information Logging** :: Every interaction with the system results in a modification of the history logs, affecting the current state of the `User profile` and system audit trails.
