=== E.5 Effects

NOTE: Elements and properties of the environment that are affected by the operation
of the system (see {Handbook}).

The operation of the Smart Home System (SHS) produces observable effects on its
environment. These effects impact physical elements of the dwelling, environmental
conditions, and external actors, without describing the internal implementation
of the system itself.
