|Risk |Severity |Mitigation Strategy

|**Tooling Complexity**
Eclipse Papyrus has a steep learning curve and can be unstable (crashes, perspective issues).
|**High**
|* Follow the "PapyrusSysMLinAction" tutorial step-by-step.
* Save work frequently.
* Use a version control system (Git) to recover previous versions in case of model corruption.

|**Scope Creep**
Temptation to model non-security features (heating, lighting) which would dilute the focus and quality of the security module.
|**Medium**
|* Strict enforcement of the "Security Only" rule defined in P.1.
* Any non-security requirement must be marked as "Out of Scope" in the requirements diagram.

|**Inconsistent Traceability**
Disconnect between the initial requirements (Safety) and the technical implementation (Components).
|**High**
|* Use SysML `<<satisfy>>` and `<<refine>>` relationships systematically.
* Perform weekly reviews to ensure every Use Case covers a specific Requirement.

|**Lack of Hardware knowledge**
Difficulty in modeling specific sensor behaviors (e.g., false positives in motion detection).
|**Low**
|* Abstraction: Model generic sensors (Boolean outputs) rather than complex physical physics.
* Consult the "PapyrusSysMLinAction" hardware abstraction layer examples.
