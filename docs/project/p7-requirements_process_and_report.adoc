|**Methodology**
|**PEGS (Presentation, Environment, Goals, System)**
The project follows the PEGS framework to structure the requirements. This ensures a clear separation between the problem domain (Goals/Environment) and the solution domain (System).

|**Elicitation Source**
|**"SysML by Example" (Papyrus)**
The primary source of requirements is the case study "Maison Intelligente de Blagnac". We extract the security-specific needs (intrusion, safety) from the general specification provided in the book.

|**Modeling Standard**
|**MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering)**
Instead of just text, requirements are modeled as SysML elements (`<<requirement>>`) and linked to the system architecture, ensuring full traceability from need to solution.

|**Report Format**
|**AsciiDoc & PDF**
The final report is generated from AsciiDoc sources. It must include snapshots of the SysML diagrams (Use Case, BDD, IBD, State Machine) to illustrate the "System" section.
