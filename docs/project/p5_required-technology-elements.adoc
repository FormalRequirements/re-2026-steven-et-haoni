=== P.5 Required technology elements

[role="pegs"]
NOTE: Hardware and software resources available or to be acquired.

The project requires the following specific hardware and software resources to ensure successful modeling, development, and documentation:

[[p5-env]]
^`P.5.{counter:p5}`^ **Modeling Environment** +
The core tool for the project is **Eclipse Papyrus**. A standard Eclipse installation (Modeling Tools package recommended) is required, with the Papyrus plugin installed (version tailored to SysML 1.4/1.6) to create and validate the system models.

[[p5-jdk]]
^`P.5.{counter:p5}`^ **Development Kit** +
**Java JDK (version 11 or higher)** is required. It is necessary to run the Eclipse platform and to implement any software components or simulations related to the OSGi framework used by the gateway.

[[p5-doc]]
^`P.5.{counter:p5}`^ **Documentation Tools** +
The **AsciiDoctor** toolchain is required to render these `.adoc` files into the final PDF or HTML report. This includes the necessary Ruby gems or the VS Code extension for live preview.

[[p5-git]]
^`P.5.{counter:p5}`^ **Version Control** +
A **Git client** (command line or GUI like GitKraken/SourceTree) is essential to manage model versions, handle the `.project` files, and facilitate collaborative work on the Papyrus models.

[[p5-emu]]
^`P.5.{counter:p5}`^ **Target Hardware Emulation** +
Since physical hardware (ZigBee sensors, physical siren) might not be immediately available for all developers, the project will rely on a **SHS Gateway Emulator**. This software emulation mimics the behavior of the Residential Gateway and its peripherals within the Java/OSGi environment.
