|Phase / Time |Description & Milestone

|**Phase 1**
(Week 1)
|**Requirements Analysis & Scoping**
* Definition of the security perimeter (Intrusion detection, Alarm management).
* Identification of actors (Inhabitants, Intruders, Emergency Services).
* **Milestone:** Requirements Diagram complete and validated.

|**Phase 2**
(Week 2)
|**Functional Analysis**
* Elaboration of Use Cases (e.g., "Arm System", "Detect Intrusion").
* Drafting of nominal and alternative scenarios.
* **Milestone:** Use Case Diagram and Sequence Diagrams finalized.

|**Phase 3**
(Week 3)
|**Structural Architecture Design**
* Definition of system blocks (Sensors, Control Unit, Siren).
* Modeling of interfaces and flows between components.
* **Milestone:** Block Definition Diagram (BDD) and Internal Block Diagram (IBD) complete.

|**Phase 4**
(Week 4)
|**Behavioral Modeling & Simulation**
* Detailed modeling of the Alarm Controller states (Idle, Armed, Ringing).
* Simulation of intrusion scenarios to validate logic.
* **Milestone:** State Machine Diagrams validated.

|**Phase 5**
(Week 5)
|**Final Review & Reporting**
* Consolidation of all models into the final document.
* Traceability check (Ensuring all requirements are met).
* **Milestone:** Final Project Delivery (PDF Document & Papyrus Model).
