=== P.2 Imposed technical choices

[role="pegs"]
NOTE: Hardware and software platform, system software and tools, programming languages.

The following technical constraints are imposed by the project specifications and the educational context of the "SysML by Example" case study:

[[p2-sysml]]
^`P.2.{counter:p2}`^ **Modeling Language** +
The project must use **SysML (Systems Modeling Language)** version 1.4 or higher. This standard is mandatory for all phases of analysis, design, and validation of the Smart Home System.

[[p2-tool]]
^`P.2.{counter:p2}`^ **Modeling Tool** +
The use of **Eclipse Papyrus** is required. It serves as the primary IDE for creating diagrams (Requirements, Use Cases, Classes, State Machines). The project files must be compatible with the Papyrus EMF format.

[[p2-impl]]
^`P.2.{counter:p2}`^ **Implementation Language** +
The software components for the gateway must be developed in **Java**. This choice ensures compatibility with the OSGi service platform used in the residential gateway environment.

[[p2-arch]]
^`P.2.{counter:p2}`^ **Software Architecture** +
The system follows a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** based on the **OSGi Framework**. The security features must be implemented as modular bundles that can be dynamically started or stopped on the gateway.

[[p2-hw]]
^`P.2.{counter:p2}`^ **Target Hardware** +
The system runs on a **Residential Gateway** (simulated or hardware like Raspberry Pi). This gateway acts as the central coordinator, communicating with sensors and external services.

[[p2-periph]]
^`P.2.{counter:p2}`^ **Peripherals & Protocols** +
The security module interacts with home automation sensors (Motion, Door/Window contact). In the absence of physical hardware, these are simulated using standard protocols (abstraction of ZigBee/EnOcean).

[[p2-doc]]
^`P.2.{counter:p2}`^ **Documentation Format** +
The final report and requirements documentation must be written in **AsciiDoc**. This ensures separation between content and formatting, allowing for professional PDF generation.
