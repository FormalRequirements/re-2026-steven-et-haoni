| Category |Choice / Constraint

|Modeling Language
|**SysML (Systems Modeling Language)** version 1.4 or higher is mandatory for all system analysis and design phases.

|Modeling Tool
|**Eclipse Papyrus**. The project must be modeled using this specific IDE to ensure compatibility with the provided examples and validation tools.

|Implementation Language
|**Java**. The software components must be developed in Java to be compatible with the OSGi framework used in the residential gateway.

|Software Architecture
|**OSGi Framework**. The system must be designed as a set of modular bundles (services) that can be dynamically installed/started on the gateway.

|Target Hardware
|**Residential Gateway** (e.g., Raspberry Pi or similar compliant box). It acts as the central node managing security logic.

|Peripherals & Sensors
|**Wireless Sensors**. The security module must interact with standard home automation protocols (simulated or real interfaces for ZigBee/EnOcean) for motion detectors and door/window opening sensors.

|Documentation
|**AsciiDoc**. All requirements and reports must be written in AsciiDoc format to generate the final PDF documentation.
