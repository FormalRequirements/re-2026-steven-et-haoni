=== G.1 Context and overall objectives

NOTE: High-level view of the project: organizational context and reason for building a system
(see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome
Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

The Smart Home (MI) aims to provide a safe, adaptive, and sustainable living environment.
It must ensure both physical and digital security, adapt to occupant needs — particularly
for people with disabilities — assist with care and daily activities, while meeting strict
energy efficiency and ecological objectives.

The Smart Home System (SHS) of the Maison Intelligente de Blagnac (MIB) is designed to
support people living at home who are autonomous but potentially vulnerable. The system
focuses on safety, security, and assistance while preserving occupants’ privacy and autonomy.

From a security perspective, the Smart Home System must protect both the physical
integrity of the dwelling and the safety of its occupants. Due to the high level of
connectivity of the system, cybersecurity and data protection are also critical concerns.

The overall objective of the SHS is to provide a secure living environment that prevents
intrusions, detects dangerous situations, protects personal data, and facilitates rapid
intervention by emergency services when required.
