=== G.3 Expected Benefits

NOTE: New processes, or improvements to existing processes, made possible by the
project’s results (see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome
Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

The implementation of the Smart Home System is expected to provide significant
improvements in terms of security, occupant assistance, and energy efficiency.
These benefits directly address the limitations identified in the current situation
(see G.2).

By integrating physical security, cybersecurity, and occupant safety mechanisms
within a single intelligent system, the Smart Home enhances both protection and
quality of life for its occupants.
