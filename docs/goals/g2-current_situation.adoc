=== G.2 Current Situation

NOTE: Current state of processes to be addressed by the project and the resulting system
(see {Handbook}).

==== Evaluation of current practices

Currently, smart home and traditional home systems show limitations in terms of
security, occupant assistance, and global energy management. These limitations lead
to risks such as unauthorized access, insufficient user support, and non-optimized
energy consumption.

Existing solutions provide partial functionalities related to security, assistance,
and energy management, but they fail to ensure comprehensive protection against
both cyberattacks and physical intrusions. Moreover, they do not fully address the
specific needs of people with disabilities.

In traditional homes, security mainly relies on mechanical locks, human vigilance,
and isolated alarm systems. These mechanisms provide limited protection and often
require manual intervention.

For vulnerable occupants, the absence of continuous monitoring may result in delayed
assistance in the event of incidents such as falls, intrusions, or fires. In addition,
most existing homes lack integrated mechanisms to control access to personal data or
to prevent cyber threats.

This situation highlights the need for an intelligent system capable of combining
physical security, occupant safety, and cybersecurity in a unified and automated
manner.
