=== G.5 High-Level Usage Scenarios

NOTE: Fundamental usage paths through the system, expressed from the stakeholders’
point of view (see {Handbook}).


//---- Scenario
==== ^`G.5.{counter:g5}`^ Intrusion detection and alert

When the occupant is away or asleep, the Smart Home System monitors access points
and security sensors.

If an intrusion or unauthorized access attempt is detected, the system blocks the
access, triggers an alarm, and automatically notifies the appropriate emergency
services.

The occupant is informed of the situation through the available notification
channels.
//----


//---- Scenario
==== ^`G.5.{counter:g5}`^ Emergency assistance after a fall

An occupant moves within the dwelling under normal conditions.

If the system detects a fall followed by a lack of response to confirmation requests,
it automatically triggers an emergency procedure.

Emergency medical services are contacted with the relevant information, and the
occupant is assisted until help arrives.
//----


//---- Scenario
==== ^`G.5.{counter:g5}`^ Fire detection and evacuation assistance

During normal operation, the Smart Home System continuously monitors environmental
conditions such as smoke.

When smoke is detected, the system alerts the occupants, assists evacuation through
guidance mechanisms, and contacts the fire department to ensure rapid intervention.
//----


//---- Scenario
==== ^`G.5.{counter:g5}`^ Secure and adaptive daily living

The occupant lives in a secure and personalized environment adapted to their profile
and specific needs.

The system prevents unauthorized access, assists the occupant with daily activities,
and dynamically adjusts energy consumption to ensure safety, comfort, and reduced
environmental impact.
