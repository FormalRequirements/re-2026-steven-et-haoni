=== G.7 Stakeholders and Requirements Sources

NOTE: Groups of people who can affect the project or be affected by it, and other
places to consider for information about the project and system (see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome
Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

The requirements of the Smart Home System originate from multiple categories of
stakeholders and authoritative sources. These stakeholders express needs related
to security, safety, assistance, privacy, and energy efficiency, while external
sources provide regulatory and contextual constraints.
