"MIB","8","What specific encryption algorithms should be used for data at rest and in transit?","Data at rest should be encrypted using strong symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES-256 to ensure confidentiality of stored medical and personal information. Data in transit should be protected using secure communication protocols such as TLS 1.2 or higher, ensuring encryption, integrity, and authentication of exchanged data between system components."
"MIB","9","What authentication mechanisms should be implemented to verify user identity?","The system should implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) combining something the user knows (password or PIN), something the user has (security token or mobile device), and, when applicable, something the user is (biometric authentication such as fingerprint or facial recognition). Strong password policies and secure session management should also be enforced."
"MIB","10","How should role-based access control be implemented to limit data access?","Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented by defining clear user roles (e.g., patient, healthcare professional, system administrator) and assigning permissions according to the principle of least privilege. Access to sensitive data should be logged and monitored, with audit trails maintained to detect unauthorized or abnormal access attempts."
"MIB","11","Which specific data protection and privacy regulations should the SHS comply with (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR)?","The SHS should comply with applicable data protection and privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Union and HIPAA for healthcare data protection in the United States. Compliance should include data minimization, user consent management, data access rights, and secure data handling procedures."
"MIB","12","How frequently should software updates be implemented to maintain system security?","Security updates should be applied regularly, with critical security patches deployed as soon as they become available. Routine software updates should be scheduled at least monthly, while system audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted periodically to ensure ongoing security compliance."
"MIB","13","What specific failure modes should the SHS be designed to withstand without affecting user safety or comfort?","The SHS should be designed to withstand common failure modes such as temporary power loss, individual sensor malfunctions, communication failures between system components, and software process crashes.

"MIB","14","What redundancy mechanisms should be implemented in the SHS to ensure continuous operation of safety-related functions?","The SHS should implement redundancy mechanisms such as N+1 redundancy for critical sensors, backup power supplies (e.g., battery or UPS), watchdog timers to detect system hangs, and self-diagnostic features to identify faults. Failover mechanisms should automatically switch to backup components to ensure uninterrupted operation of safety-related functions."
"MIB","15","What are the acceptable comfort levels in case of a system failure that does not compromise user safety?","In the event of a non-critical system failure, the acceptable comfort level should be limited to minor inconvenience or temporary discomfort, such as manual adjustment of lighting or temperature. The failure should not significantly disrupt the user’s daily activities, sleep quality, or overall well-being, and normal comfort should be restored as soon as the system recovers."
"MIB","16","How should the SHS's MTBF of at least 1000 hours be verified and validated?","The SHS’s MTBF should be verified and validated through a combination of accelerated life testing, system simulations, and long-term field data analysis. Reliability metrics should be continuously monitored during deployment, and test results should be documented to demonstrate compliance with the minimum MTBF requirement of 1000 hours."
"MIB","17","What specific types of sensors are used to collect data from the bed?","The SHS collects data from the bed using sensors such as pressure sensors to detect body presence and posture, motion sensors to monitor movement during sleep, and temperature sensors to measure body or mattress temperature.
