------------------ Generated Specification -----------------

The Smart Home System (SHS) should be highly user-friendly, with an intuitive and accessible interface supporting multiple interaction modes, such as mobile applications, voice commands, and automated operation. It should require minimal user intervention, provide clear feedback, and allow easy customization of preferences. The SHS should meet high reliability requirements, with a mean time between failures (MTBF) of at least 1000 hours, and safety-related functions should include redundancy and fail-safe mechanisms to ensure continuous operation. The SHS should implement strong security measures, including encryption of data at rest and in transit, secure authentication mechanisms, role-based access control, and regular software updates. Access to sensitive personal and medical data should be limited to authorized users and compliant with data protection and privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. The SHS should be designed to withstand common failure modes such as temporary power loss, individual sensor malfunctions, and communication failures, and in these situations, the system should continue to operate in a degraded but safe mode. The SHS should implement redundancy mechanisms such as N+1 redundancy for critical sensors, backup power supplies, watchdog timers, and self-diagnostic features to ensure uninterrupted operation of safety-related functions. In the event of a non-critical system failure, the acceptable comfort level should be limited to minor inconvenience or temporary discomfort. The SHS should react to safety-critical changes in the user’s environment within a few seconds and to comfort-related adjustments within a short delay, generally within 1 to 5 minutes. The SHS should collect data from the bed using sensors such as pressure sensors, motion sensors, and temperature sensors, and process this data using a combination of rule-based systems and data analysis or machine learning algorithms to infer the user’s activity and condition. Based on the inferred user activity and condition, the SHS can trigger actions such as adjusting environmental settings, sending notifications or alerts, and logging relevant data in the Medical Information System. The SHS should support multiple interaction modes, including a mobile application, voice commands, touch-based interfaces, and fully automated operation, and provide customization options such as language selection, interface theme and font size adjustments, accessibility features, and personalized automation routines based on user habits and preferences. The SHS should provide clear and immediate feedback through visual indicators, auditory signals, and notifications via connected devices.
